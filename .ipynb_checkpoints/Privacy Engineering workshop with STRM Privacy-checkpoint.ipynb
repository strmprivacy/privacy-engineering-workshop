    "1. For which purposes can we use this data without additional privacy transformations?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, specify the *Key field*. This must be a required field of type `STRING` and determines which events share their encryption keys. All events with the same value for the key field will contain the same encrypted string for any identical values. (This allows for some analysis on encrypted data: keys rotate after 24 hours, so within that window, some patterns and trends are preserved)\n",

    "![classify fields](images/classify-fields-2.png)\n",

    "Under *PII fields*, specify for each sensitive field to which purpose it belongs. For example, 1 could denote analytics, and 2 marketing. We are currently working on a more descriptive way that uses a purpose mapping defined for your organization. Note that only (repeated) `STRING` fields can be marked as PII.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also include field validations. Currently, we support regex patterns as validations. These are simple (but powerful) validations that will ensure only events with valid data will be accepted and further processed. In the example above, the `tshirtSize` must be one of the allowed options. Sending an event that does not match the pattern, will be rejected with HTTP status code 400.\n",
    "\n",
